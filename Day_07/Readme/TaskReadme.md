# Day 7 Challenge: Hands-On Jenkins Magic: Build, Test, Deploy a Flask App!

Hello EveryOne,

Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

Today, we will explore the power of CI/CD automation by setting up a Jenkins pipeline for a Python Flask application. </br>This hands-on challenge will help you understand the essentials of CI/CD practices, including testing, containerization, and automated deployment.



## Requirements:
### Pipeline Setup:
- Clone the Repository:
  Use the following GitHub repository for the Python Flask app:
    [Flask Example App](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/main/examples/tutorial)</br>
  You can aslo clone from my repository.

- Set Up the Environment:
  Install dependencies using pip and create a Python virtual environment.

- Run Unit Tests:
  Execute unit tests using pytest to validate the app.

- Build a Docker Image:
  Use a Dockerfile to containerize the application.

- Push Docker Image:
  Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

- Deploy the Application:
  Deploy the container locally, exposing it on port 5000.


CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern DevOps workflows, enabling rapid, reliable application development and deployment. </br>By completing this challenge, you'll enhance your skills in setting up robust automation for Python-based applications.
